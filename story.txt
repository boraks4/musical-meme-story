There once... was a man named Jim. Jim was a good man with a heart of gold... He would do anything if it meant helping another with their problems. One day, Jim was walking through the public pool, when he spotted something suspicious... There was a child drowning! And the life guard was on lunch break!

Of course Jim would help! There was no doubt. But wait ... Jim does not know how to swim. Worse still, he is pretty much allergic to a big body of water. He never goes to any pool or lake or beach because that scares the xyz out of him. But the kid was actually drowning! What should he do???
